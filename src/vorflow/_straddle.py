"""Pure-geometry placement of barrier straddle pairs and of the lines that cross them.

Shapely only, no Gmsh calls; ``MeshGenerator`` turns the result into OCC
points and curves (see ``engine.py``).

Methodology
-----------
*Straddle pairs.* A barrier or straddle line (no quad buffer) is not meshed
as a curve. Pairs of points at +/-eps along its normal (eps =
``straddle_width / 2``, else ``0.2 * lc``) are placed about ``lc`` apart, so
the Voronoi edge between the two points of a pair, their perpendicular
bisector, lies on the line. End pairs on an oblique domain boundary slide
inward along the line until both points are inside (``_end_pair_slide``).

*Crossings.* An embedded standard line that crosses an embedded straddle line
would otherwise be trimmed back by the barrier corridor (1.2 * eps), leaving
its end node at an arbitrary offset from the nearest pair. Instead the
crossing becomes an anchor: a pair is placed exactly at it, the other pairs
are spaced evenly between consecutive anchors and barrier ends, and the line
ends on the pair point on each side (``_align_line_to_crossings``).

*Oblique crossings.* The pair stays perpendicular to the barrier, because a
pair laid along the crossing line would put its bisector (the Voronoi edge)
off the barrier. The line bends instead: its last segment runs from its
first node beyond the crossing to the pair point. On the acute side of an
oblique crossing the line's next nodes lie close to the barrier, where their
cells would reach across it (or squeeze the pairs there). Those nodes are
placed at a known spacing and mirrored across the barrier; each node and its
mirror act as one more pair (a wider one) and as a fixed point for the even
spacing of the regular pairs. A generator set that is mirror-symmetric about
the barrier has no Voronoi edge crossing it, so the barrier cells stay
closed and symmetric.

A crossing that cannot be anchored (too close to a barrier end or another
anchor, pair outside the domain, collinear overlap, or no room to bend) keeps
the old behaviour: the line is trimmed by the barrier zone.
