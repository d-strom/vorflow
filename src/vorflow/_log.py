"""Package-wide logging setup.

vorflow reports progress through the standard :mod:`logging` module under the
``"vorflow"`` logger. Messages keep the plain look of the old ``print()``
output, but can now be silenced, made more verbose, or redirected to a file
without touching library code.

Verbosity mapping (same scale MeshGenerator has always documented):

- ``0`` — silent: only warnings and errors are shown.
- ``1`` — basic progress messages (the package default).
- ``2`` — debug diagnostics (the ``[DIAG]`` output).

By default vorflow prints to the console through its own handler and does not
propagate to the root logger, so applications that configure logging do not
see messages twice. Call ``set_verbosity(level, console=False)`` to drop the
console handler and let messages propagate to the application's handlers
(this is also what pytest's ``caplog`` needs).
