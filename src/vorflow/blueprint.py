        Adds a polygon feature, such as a model boundary or a refinement zone.

        Args:
            geometry (shapely.Polygon): The polygon geometry.
            zone_id (int or str): A unique identifier for the zone.
            resolution (float, optional): Target mesh size within this polygon. If None,
                the background mesh size will be used.
            z_order (int): Stacking order for resolving overlaps. Higher values are
                processed first and will "cut" into lower-order polygons. Also acts
                as the crossing priority when this polygon's quad buffer crosses

                the two independently, add the zone without ``quad_buffer`` and add
                its boundary as a separate quad-buffered line with its own z_order.
            dist_min (float, optional): DEPRECATED. Distance from the polygon boundary where
                the mesh size is held constant at the boundary's resolution. Supplying
                dist_min/dist_max selects the legacy linear ThresholdField transition and

            dist_max (float, optional): DEPRECATED. Distance from the polygon boundary over
                which the mesh transitions to the background resolution. See dist_min.
            growth_factor (float, optional): Cell-to-cell growth ratio (>1.0) for the default
                GeometricGrowthField size transition away from the feature. Defaults to 1.2.
                Ignored when an explicit ``fields`` list or the legacy dist_min/dist_max is given.
            densify (float|bool|None, optional): Controls polygon boundary densification:
                - If False, disables densification.
                - If True, densifies using `resolution` (lc). Requires `resolution` to be set.
                - If a float, densifies so no boundary segment is longer than this value.
                Raises ValueError if non-positive when specified as a float.
            simplify_tolerance (float|int|None, optional): If a number > 0, applies Douglas-Peucker
                simplification with this tolerance. If None or 0, no simplification is applied.
                Boundary shared exactly with another polygon is left unsimplified so
                neighbouring zones never open gaps. Raises ValueError if negative.
                Boolean values are not supported.
            fields (list, optional): List of MeshField objects.
            embed (bool): If True, the polygon is embedded in the mesh. If False, it is used only for fields.
            quad_buffer (bool): If True, replaces the meshed polygon outline
                with a quad band straddling it (the annulus between the
                ``+/- thickness * resolution / 2`` offsets, meshed as
                recombined quads; annuli cannot be 4-corner transfinite). The
                outline itself never becomes mesh edges: with
                ``quad_buffer_thickness=1`` no nodes fall on it, so the Voronoi
                cell faces trace the shapefile shape; with ``2`` a node row
                lands on it, giving a row of ~square cells centered on the
                shape. (For the triangular element-grid deliverable the reading
                is opposite: ``2`` puts element edges along the outline.)
                When the band crosses another quad buffer, the higher-priority
                feature (``z_order``, then finer resolution, wider strip, lines
                over polygons) stays continuous and only the other is trimmed
                with a warning; polygons narrower than the band fall back to a
                plain outline with a warning.
            quad_buffer_thickness (int): Band width in local cell widths
                (multiples of ``resolution``, like gmshflow's ``cs_thick``).
                Supported values are 1 and 2.
            mesh_refinement (bool, optional): DEPRECATED, has no effect (it was
                never read by the mesh generator).
            border_density (float, optional): DEPRECATED. Densifies the boundary
                to this spacing (use ``densify``) and grades the interior from this
                finer border size up to ``resolution`` over ``dist_min`` to

            dist_max_in (float, optional): DEPRECATED. Interior grading distance

            dist_max (float, optional): DEPRECATED. Distance from the line over which the mesh
                transitions to the background resolution. See dist_min.
            straddle_width (float, optional): If set, forces Voronoi cell edges to align
                perfectly with the line by creating a "virtual straddle" of mesh nodes.
            fields (list, optional): List of MeshField objects.
            embed (bool): If True, the line is embedded in the mesh. If False, it is used only for fields.
            densify (float or bool, optional): Controls line densification:
                - If False, disables densification.
                - If True, densifies the line using the `resolution` value.
                - If a float, densifies the line so that no segment is longer than this value.
                Raises ValueError if negative or zero.
            simplify_tolerance (float|int|None, optional): If a number > 0, simplifies the line with
                this tolerance using Douglas-Peucker algorithm. If None or 0, no simplification is applied.
                Raises ValueError if negative. Boolean values are not supported.
            quad_buffer (bool): If True, creates an opt-in structured quad buffer
                strip around the line instead of the lightweight straddle points.
                The strip is meshed as a 4-corner transfinite surface (structured
                quad rows): with ``quad_buffer_thickness=1`` no nodes fall on
                the line, so the Voronoi faces align with it (sharp barrier);
                with ``2`` a node row lands on it, giving a row of ~square
                Voronoi cells centered on the line. (For the triangular
                element-grid deliverable the reading is opposite: ``2`` puts
                element edges along the line.) When two quad buffers cross,
                the higher-priority one stays continuous and only the other is
                trimmed at the crossing with a warning (priority: ``z_order``,
                then finer resolution, wider strip, lines over polygons,
                insertion order). Strips crossing a barrier/straddle corridor
                are still trimmed there. Independent of ``is_barrier``.
            quad_buffer_thickness (int): Strip width in local cell widths
                (multiples of ``resolution``, like gmshflow's ``cs_thick``).
                Supported values are 1 and 2.
            z_order (int): Crossing priority for quad buffers. When this
                feature's quad buffer crosses another one, the feature with the
                higher ``z_order`` keeps its strip continuous and the other is
                trimmed. Lines do not participate in polygon overlap stacking.
            growth_factor (float, optional): Cell-to-cell growth ratio (>1.0) for the default
                GeometricGrowthField size transition away from the line. Defaults to 1.2.
                Ignored when an explicit ``fields`` list or the legacy dist_min/dist_max is given.
